Ensure you have a header with your Name, Student ID number, and Github name in each source file!

This is an individual assignment.  This assignment is in JavaScript in a web browser page.  There are no specifications (for the type or style of game) other than it be a game of your choice, and it must not be one of the banned games below. It may be one player, multi-player, or 0 player (such as a simulation). The main goals are to use the HTML &lt;canvas&gt; tag and then draw on it with Javascript. See W3School's [HTML Canvas Graphics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) page to help you get started.  

Do not use any Javascript stacks or frameworks -- we want your original, code, written by you.

*** VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE "alert();" ***

Submit your code to your github repo with all the files necessary to run your game and the write-up, following our standard write-up template. The writeup describes your project/game, including how to play, rules, etc. and the write-up should also include any issues and how you resolved them. The write-up should also be submitted to Canvas, as usual, as well.

Banned Games:

* Pong
* Breakout
* Flappy Bird
* Snake
* Tic-Tac-Toe
* Memory Game (trying to match tiles)
* Hangman
